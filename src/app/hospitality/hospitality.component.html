        Despite its varied and multifarious character, the industry does have two main defining features. 
        One is its reliance on leisure and luxury activities and services rather than basic physical needs, 
        making it vulnerable during times when the economy is struggling. The other is its chief focus: 
        customer satisfaction.
        The hospitality Industry includes the broad category of fields including event planning, cruise line, 
        transportation, tourism industry, lodging and theme parts. It is a multi billion dollar industry. 
        The success of hospitality industry depends on the disposable income and leisure time. It consists of 
        multiple groups such as facility maintenance and direct operations.
